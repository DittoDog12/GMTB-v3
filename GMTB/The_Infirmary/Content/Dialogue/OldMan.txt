Old Man Burt: Hello my Boy! You have to get out, or else you'll die!
The Boy: What?
Old Man Burt: Get out or they will kill you. 
The Boy: Who will?
Old Man Burt: The workers. The exit is in the basement. 
Old Man Burt: Find the items that will unlock the stairs because they have them blocked.
The Boy: I don't follow.
Old Man Burt: You best run, my Boy! There's one of them!
